# Kybele

Kybele is a Rhino–Grasshopper plugin for Radiance-based daylight and electric lighting simulation, spectral and hyperspectral lighting data integration, and plant growth prediction.

## Overview
Kybele supports performance-driven greenhouse and controlled-environment design workflows by computing lighting metrics from both daylight and electric lighting across three-channel and hyperspectral domains.
